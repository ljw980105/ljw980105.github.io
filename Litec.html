    <h1 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h1>
    <h4 style="text-align: left">An <span style="text-decoration: underline">Embedded System</span> is a computer
        system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system. It is embedded as part of a
        complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts, used to control many devices in common use
        today, such as light dimmers, traffic lights, avionics and even hybrid vehicles.<br><br> As an RPI student, me
        and my teammates have engineered two embedded systems successfully during the Fall 2017 semester. The first
        is a Smart Car capable of driving, steering and course correction, and with abilities such as avoiding obstacles.
        The second is an Upside-down Blimp capable of maintaining a constant heading with two thrust fans installed on the side
        of it. I'm very proud of what we've accomplished in such a short semester.</h4>

                    We implemented all our hardware with sophisticated wiring and design on a single protoboard, also
                    known as a breadboard. Good hardware design goes a long way.

                <p>
                    Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) on the Smart Car converts an voltage supplied by the hardware into
                    a digital value ranging from 0 to 255. By combining this technology with the voltage-altering
                    potentiometer, we are able to adjust software parameters with on-board hardware.

                    Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a type of digital signal sent in pulses, allowing the practitioner to
                    control the power supplied to electrical devices. In the context of our embedded systems, PWM is utilized
                    to control the speed and direction of motors on both the Blimp and the Smart Car.

                    seamless communication between hardware and software. Without it, our ideas wouldn't come to life.

                    devices to microprocessors for short-range communication. We've implemented this standard to take advantage
                    of the power of ranger, compass and accelerometer for use on our embedded systems.

        <h4>
            For the smart car, we engineered it to perform driving tasks by developing hardware and software simultaneously.
            The driving speed of the car is altered via manipulating PWM pulsewidths, and control algorithms determine the
            course correction behavior of the car. Three peripheral devices also played important roles in this project: compass,
            ranger and accelerometer. In order to make these work correctly, we wired up I2C hardware on the protoboard.<br><br>
            In Lab 4 and 5, our hardware and software are put to test. In Lab 4, the smart car must be able to detect obstacles,
            stop and turn until the obstacle is out of the way, then resume driving. We use the ranger to detect obstacles: obstacle
            is present when the distance read by the ranger is less than a threshold we specified. When such condition is true,
            the car turns around while checking compass readings to make sure it does not turn too far. When the ranger reading is
            normal again, the embedded system exits the turning state and resumes normal driving. In Lab 5, the smart car utilizes
            accelerometer readings to provide data to the control algorithm which ensures the car would drive up the ramp reversely.

        <h4>
            For the Gondola, it's a little bit eccentric: it's intended to fly, but it has to be placed upside down on the
            turntable for safety reasons. The only thing it does is to spin. It has two thrust fans and one tail fan, both
            of which are used to control the heading of the soon-to-be blimp. In Lab 6, our task is to maintain heading.
            In order to do so, two thrust fans, which are installed on the side of the blimp, have to rotate in the opposite
            direction. Hence, we implemented code which successfully set the pulsewidth of both fans in a reversed fashion.
            With the help of compass, we implemented the PD (Proportional-Derivative) control algorithm to make sure the
            gondola faces a desired direction (maintain heading). A ranger is installed atop the gondola. Our code is also
            capable of changing the direction the gondola faces based on the reading of ranger.
