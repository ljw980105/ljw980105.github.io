    <p>
        Hi all! This is Li (I like to be referred to by my last name), and I’m currently a sophomore Electrical & Computer Systems Engineering major at RPI. Since I was the head programmer of the FIRST Robotics Team 1635 at my high school, I have three years of programming / electronics experience in Java & Arduino (elementary), which are further enhanced with my RPI CS classes in Python and C++. And that 3 years did influence my career goals tremendously – I would love to have a career in robotics or AI. Besides that, my interests also include computer hardware, software development, and electronic manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prior to my entrance to RPI, I’ve had a brief internship experience in electronic manufacturing at Quadlogic Controls Corp. I was drafting AutoCAD schematics of electronic measuring devices, as well as learning technical skills such as soldering.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides academia, I also love photography, videography, and graphics designing. Instead of making posters or resumes using templates, I love to add my personal touch of graphics designing into them, making them stand out in the crowd. Instead of making standard PPTs, I love to add unique narratives by making a video, many of them are shot with my DSLR. As a result, I have made a substantial amount of videos for both my robotics team and myself. You can find them at my Youtube Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC33WP6-Af8Oy7SGzZm5mxng/videos.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m currently looking for a summer internship or an undergraduate research position. You can email me at lij30@rpi.edu and ljw9801055@gmail.com.
