    <p>
        Hi all! This is Jing, and I’m a rising junior majoring in Computer
        Science & Computer Systems Engineering at RPI. The inception of my career was in the sophomore year of high
        school, when I joined the FIRST Robotics Team. I fell in love with computer science and electrical engineering
        portion of it almost immediately. Before I knew it, I became the programming team captain and programmed three
        fantastic robots along with other programmers in my team. Three years later, I was admitted to RPI, and graduated
        high school with a internship in NYC, where I designed AutoCAD models of electrical products and gained a plethora
        of hands-on experiences in electronics manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I entered RPI, the focus of my career shifted to software development, as I perfected my programming skills
        with programming languages including Python, Java, C++ and C, as well as core concepts such as Data Structures
        and Algorithms.  The summer after my freshman year, I was hooked to web design, and moved on to produce my personal
        website with technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, ReactJS and Sass. You are welcome to checkout
        all of my development experiences, precisely documented on <a href="https://github.com/ljw980105/">GitHub </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was also that summer that I started to take Stanford’s CS193P class in iOS Development. By the end of 2017, I
        produced my own music client app and a Twitter client, and I was shocked on how much I love mobile development.
        My skills in iOS dev increased exponentially as I mastered Swift, Objective-C and numerous first-party and third-party
        iOS frameworks. During the spring of 2018, I obtained a research position in RPI, where I went on to make an
        Augmented Reality App to view three dimensional models, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of STEM education.
        The summer after my sophomore year, I secured a mobile software engineering internship at Modernizing Medicine,
        where I was tasked to work on medical technology apps capable of improving the lives of over 160 million patients.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides academia, I also love photography, videography, and graphic design. I have been working at RPI as graphic
        designer for over a year now, and I totally love that job. Instead of making posters or resumes using templates,
        I love to add my personal touch of graphics designing into them, making them stand out in the crowd. Instead of
        making standard PPTs, I love to add unique narratives by making a video, many of them are shot with my DSLR. As
        a result, I have made a substantial amount of videos for both my robotics team and myself. You can find them at
        my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC33WP6-Af8Oy7SGzZm5mxng">Youtube Channel</a> .
